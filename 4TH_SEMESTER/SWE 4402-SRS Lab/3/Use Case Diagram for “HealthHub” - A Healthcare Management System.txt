Creating a Use Case Diagram for “HealthHub” - A
Healthcare Management System

Background:

The city of Greenfield is embarking on a digital transformation journey in its healthcare
sector with the introduction of "HealthHub,” an innovative healthcare management system.
This ambitious project aims to integrate various aspects of healthcare services, offering a
seamless, user-friendly platform for patients, doctors, healthcare administrators, and
insurance providers.

HealthHub’s mission is to simplify and enhance the healthcare experience through
technology. It will serve a range of functions from appointment scheduling to managing
complex medical records, facilitating online consultations, and handling billing and
insurance processes. This system is expected to cater to a diverse user base with varying
needs:

e Patients looking for easy access to medical services, appointment bookings, and
health information.

e Doctors requiring efficient management of patient records, scheduling, and
telemedicine capabilities.

e Healthcare Administrators overseeing operational aspects like record keeping, staff
management, and patient service optimization.

e Insurance Providers interfacing with the hospital's billing systems and managing
claims.

Your Task:

As future software engineers, your task is to develop a detailed use case diagram for
HealthHub. Your diagram should accurately depict the system’s functionalities and user
interactions. Your diagram must include:

e Atleast 10 associations (simple connections between actors and use cases).

e A minimum of 2 generalizations (showing hierarchical relationships among actors).

e At least 3 extends (indicating optional use cases that extend the functionality of
another use case).
e A minimum of 4 includes (representing a use case that is a mandatory part of
another use case).

Scenario Overview:

Primary Actors:
e Patients.
e Doctors.

e Healthcare Administrators.
e Insurance Providers.
Key System Functions:
e Appointment Scheduling.
e Medical Record Management.
e Online Consultations.
e Prescription Management.
e Billing and Insurance Processing.

Activity:

Diagram Development:
e Construct a use case diagram for HealthHub incorporating the specified
number of associations, generalizations, extends, and includes.
e Ensure all elements in your diagram are clearly labeled and organized.
Justification and Explanation:
e For each type of relation used in your diagram (association, generalization,
extend, include), provide a rationale for its application.

Definitions of Relation Types:

e Association: A binary relationship between an actor and a use case indicating
interaction.

e Generalization: A hierarchical relationship where a child actor inherits the role of a
parent actor.

e Extend: A relationship where a use case adds new behaviors or actions to another use
case, typically under specific conditions.

e Include: A relationship denoting that one use case is inherently part of another use
case’s process.
Deliverable:

e Acomprehensive use case diagram for HealthHub with the required relationships.
e A document explaining the reasoning behind the application of each relation type in
your diagram.
